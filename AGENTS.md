# AGENTS.md — loom-run

Human owns architecture and stop decisions. AI is a junior pair.

## Scope

- One small change per request: one module, test file, or integration step.
- Do not port all of `agents_architecture` into this repo.
- `loom-run` wires coordinator + tools + loom-runner; sibling repos stay separate.

## Loop

1. Human defines boundary.
2. Propose tiny change with why + test.
3. Run `python -m pytest -q` in this repo.
4. Two failed fix attempts on the same issue → stop; human debugs.

## Invariants

- Mock LLM must keep CI green without API keys.
- Tools must work with local fallbacks when MCP is not configured.
- Managed side effects go through `RunContext.call_tool(...)`.
